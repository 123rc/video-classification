Project Title: Video Classification using CNN+RNN with Keras and TensorFlow
Description
This repository contains code for video classification using a combination of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) implemented in Keras with TensorFlow backend. The model aims to analyze temporal information from videos using CNNs for spatial features and RNNs for temporal dependencies, enabling accurate video classification across different classes.

Features
Utilizes CNNs to capture spatial features from video frames.
Implements RNNs to learn temporal dependencies between video frames.
Provides scripts for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
Requirements
Python 3.x
TensorFlow 2.x
Keras
Other dependencies (list any additional libraries or versions required)
